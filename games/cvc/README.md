Balloon Word Builder is a playful, interactive game for practicing consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Players are shown a three-letter word with one letter missing, and must choose the correct letter to complete the word. Each letter is displayed in a colorful, animated balloon. When a player selects an answer, the balloons animate and the word is spoken aloud. The game features sound options, confetti for correct answers, and a friendly, responsive design perfect for young learners.

**How to play:**
- Choose which letter to hide (first, second, third, or random) and randomization mode on the start screen.
- Click "Start 10 Rounds" to begin.
- Listen to the word, then select the correct missing letter from the options.
- Balloons animate and the word is spoken again. Confetti celebrates correct answers!
- Play again to practice more words.
